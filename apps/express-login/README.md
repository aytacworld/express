# @aytacworld/express-login

  id: string/ObjectId, // Unique identifier for the user
  username: string, // Username, be sure to check the uniqueness of the username
  password: string // The password field is plain text, so you have been warned.
}

const records = {
  '1': {id:'1', username:'bob', password:'secret'},
  '2': {id:'2', username:'jake', password:'blablabla'}
};
class Users {
  static async findById(id) {
     return new Promise((res, rej) => records[id] ? res(records[id]) : rej(new Error('User ' + id + ' does not exist')));
  }

  static async findByUsername(username) {
    return new Promise((res) => {
      for (const id in records) {
        if (records[id].username === username) {
          return res(records[id]);
        }
