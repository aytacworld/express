# @Aytacworld/express

With this module, you don't need to rewrite the express boilerplate over and over again.

Just pass your routes.

## Installation

using npm

`npm i @aytacworld/express`

using yarn

`yarn add @aytacworld/express`

## Usage

router.js
```javascript
const router = require('express').Router();
router.get('/some-page', (req, res) => res.render('some-pug-file'));
module.exports = router;
```

app.js
```javascript
const path = require('path')
const Express = require('@aytacworld/express');
const app = new Express({
  templatePath: path.resolve(__dirname, 'views'),
  routes: [
    {route: '/', path: require('./router.js')}
  ],
  staticPath: {route: 'public', path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'public-folder')}
});
app.listen(process.env.PORT);
// you can also pass http options
// this method is the same as require('http').createServer(this.app).listen(httpOptions);
```

## Options

```javascript
{
  templatePath: string, // This is the path to pug files, default './'
  routes: Array<{route: string, path: require}>, // This list contains the routing information, default []
  staticPath: {route: string, path: require}, // This is the path to static files, default false
  login: require('@aytacworld/express-login'), // This is the passport module to require, default false
  oauthServer: {route: string, module: require('@aytacworld/express-oauth')}, // This is the oauth serverside part, default false,

  authDecisionPage: string // This is the path to decisions pug file
}
```
